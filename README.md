# What is this project?
- This app allows a user to draw and erase on a whiteboard. They have the ability to adjust the thickness and color of the pen as well as choose between a pen and an eraser.

# Goal(s) of this project
- After creating my first web application, I wanted to create something more complex. I wanted to gain more experience in HTML and CSS, but my main goal was to get a good grasp of vanilla JavaScript.
